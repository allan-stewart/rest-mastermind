      <h1>REST Mastermind</h1>
      <p>
        This server hosts a RESTful API which can be used to play a mastermind-style game.
        Visit the <a href="/api">base API endpoint</a> to get started.
      </p>

      <h2>Playing the game</h2>
      <p>
        In order to play the game, you must first register as a player, then start a new game.
        The server will generate a 4-digit numeric secret value (for example <code>0380</code>)
        which the player will try to guess.
      </p>

      <p>
        The server will respond to each guess, letting the player know if they were correct.
        If the guess was incorrect, feedback is given indicating how many digits were in the
        correct position and how many were misplaced.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, if the secret value was <code>1132</code> and the player guesses <code>1234</code>,
        the result will indicate that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the guess was incorrect</li>
        <li>two characters were in the correct position</li>
        <li>one characters were misplaced</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Example API call</h2>
      <p>The HTTP request to register a player should look similar to the following:</p>
      <pre class="codeblock">POST /api/player HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:3000
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 20

{"name": "John Doe"}</pre>

      <p>Here is an example <code>curl</code> request to generate such a request:</p>
      <pre class="codeblock">curl -v -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"name": "John Doe"}' http://localhost:3000/api/player</pre>

      <p>And the result of that request would look like this:</p>
      <pre class="codeblock">*   Trying ::1...
* Connected to localhost (::1) port 3000 (#0)
> POST /api/player HTTP/1.1
