      <p>
        This server hosts a RESTful API which can be used to play a mastermind-style game.
        Visit the <a href="/api">base API endpoint</a> to get started.
      </p>

      <h2>Playing the game</h2>
      <p>
        In order to play the game, you must first register as a player, then start a new game.
        The server will generate a 6-digit numeric secret value (for example "038047")
        which the player will try to guess.
      </p>

      <p>
        The server will respond to each guess, letting the player know if they were correct.
        If the guess was incorrect, feedback is given indicating how many digits were in the
        correct position and how many were misplaced.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, if the secret value was "112223" and the player guesses "123456",
        the result will indicate that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the guess was incorrect</li>
        <li>one character was in the correct position (the 1)</li>
        <li>two characters were misplaced (the 2 and 3)</li>
      </ul>
